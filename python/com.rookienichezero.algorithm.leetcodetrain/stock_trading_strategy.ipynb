    "Given an array prices, where the i-th element prices[i] represents the price of a given stock on the i-th day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only choose one day to buy one stock and choose a different day in the future to sell that stock. Design an algorithm to calculate the maximum profit you can obtain from this transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot obtain any profit, return 0.\n",

    "## Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (stock price = 1) and sell on day 5 (stock price = 6), maximum profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "Note that the profit cannot be 7-1 = 6 because the selling price must be greater than the buying price, and you cannot sell the stock before buying it.\n",

    "## Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are completed, so the maximum profit is 0."
