    "# Title: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks II\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "You are given an integer array prices, where prices[i] represents the price of a certain stock on the i-th day.\n",
    "\n",
    "On each day, you can decide whether to buy and/or sell the stock. You can hold at most one stock at any time. You are also allowed to buy and sell on the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), the profit is 5 - 1 = 4. Then, buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), the profit is 6 - 3 = 3. Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2:\n",
    "Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), the profit is 5 - 1 = 4. Total profit is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3:\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done, so the maximum profit is 0."
